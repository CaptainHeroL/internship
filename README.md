## About

This project is my first internship task.



## Users
There are 2 types of users:
- Specialist
- Display

## guests activity
Once accessed the website, guest user will automatically be redirected to a page, where the user can create a reservation to an active specialist. After creating a reservation, guest user will be redirected to reservation display page which is displayed with important data to the user. Guests are able to cancel the reservation within this page, if needed.
