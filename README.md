## About

This project is my first internship task.



## Users
There are 2 types of users:
- Specialist
- Display

## Guests activity
Once accessed the website, guest user will automatically be redirected to a page, where the user can create a reservation to an active specialist. After creating a reservation, guest user will be redirected to reservation display page which is displayed with important data to the user. Guests are able to cancel the reservation within this page, if needed.

## Specialists activity
Once one of the specialist users are authenticated, they redirected to their personal dashboards. The dashboard contains a table with all active reservations (received or in progress) that belong to current user who can begin/cancel received client reservations and finish ongoing ones.

## Display activity
Only authorised personnel can access the display. Once display user is authenticated, user is redirected to a dashboard that contains a button which will transfer the user to the display.
